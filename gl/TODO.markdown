Things that would be nice to have
---------------------------------

* Add a class for things that can be converted to `GLenum`'s and use it instead of `GLenum` in negative position in the bindings?
* Some of the manual pages are for multiple functions, link by prefix?
* Fix issues on Windows caused by the large number of modules
* Fix distribution issues caused by having a custom `Setup.hs` with non-trivial content.
* Change Ptr () to use `Ptr a`, `Ptr b`, etc.
* Add other extension links to go to https://www.khronos.org/registry/gles/extensions/ for opengl es extensions
